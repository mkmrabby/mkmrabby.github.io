<p align="justify">
I am a senior scientist at <a href="https://www.fedex.com/en-us/dataworks.html">FedEx Dataworks</a>, where I specialize in developing AI-driven solutions for logistics and operational optimization. My work spans statistical modeling, machine learning, time-series forecasting, computer vision, and large-scale system integration using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us">Azure</a>, and <a href="https://www.databricks.com/">Databricks</a>. I have led the design of end-to-end solutions, including recommendation systems, root-cause diagnostics for package loss, and product variant identification, with a strong focus on deployment scalability and API-based services.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Prior to FedEx, I worked as data scientist (full-time) at <a href="https://www.crowley.com/">Crowley</a>, building machine learning models for ship monitoring, path planning, and financial forecasting, and as machine learning engineer (intern/part-time) at <a href="https://www.omdena.com/">Omdena-Optimiz</a>, applying deep learning for cargo claim predictions using object detection models like YOLOv5 and MobileNet-SSD.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I completed my Ph.D. in <a href="https://ncat.edu/coe/departments/ece/index.php">Electrical and Computer Engineering from North Carolina A&T State University</a>, where I was a Graduate Research Assistant in the <a href="https://www.accesslab.net/">ACCESS Lab</a>. My doctoral research focused on robotics, specifically human-robot collaboration, cognitive modeling, and autonomous motion control using AI, ML, and deep learning. My contributions included developing dynamic control systems, visual perception interfaces, and performance-aware autonomy frameworks for humanoid robots.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Earlier in my career, I served as an Assistant Engineer at the <a href="https://pgcb.gov.bd/">Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) Ltd.</a>, focusing on operation, and maintenance of medium and/or high-voltage transmission systems, substation design and quality control, and fault diagnostics, and as a Balance of Plant Engineer at <a href="https://www.kps.co.kr/eng/index.do">KEPCO-KPS</a>, <a href="https://summitpowerinternational.com/summit-meghnaghat-power-company-limited">Summit Meghnaghat Power Company Ltd.</a>, where I worked on automation in water treatment systems for power generation.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I hold an M.Sc. in <a href="https://iict.buet.ac.bd/">Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</a> and a B.Sc. in <a href="https://eee.buet.ac.bd/">Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from BUET</a>, with research specializations in wireless power transfer, sensor networks, and power system control.
